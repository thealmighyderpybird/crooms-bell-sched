## Supported Versions

The website usually updates on its own, and therefore doesn't require you to update anything. If for some reason you're on an old version, this page will tell you if it's still supported (probably not).

| Version | Supported          |
|---------|--------------------|
| 4.7.0   | :white_check_mark: |
