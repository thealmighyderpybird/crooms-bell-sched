        <p>
            While this Terms of Service document provides a comprehensive list of prohibited behaviors, administrators
            reserve the right to take action against content or behavior that may not be explicitly listed but is deemed
            harmful or disruptive. In such cases, administrators will remove the content or take appropriate
            disciplinary action as they see fit.
        </p>
        <h3>6. Consequences for Violating the Terms of Service</h3>
        <p>
            We take violations of these Terms seriously. The following actions will be taken for violations, with
            increasing severity depending on the nature of the offense:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>First Offense:</strong> You will receive a warning, unless the offense is severe enough to
                warrant immediate suspension. In severe cases, we may skip the warning and move directly to a second
                offense.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Second Offense:</strong> You will face a temporary account suspension, typically lasting one
                day, though it may be
                extended depending on the violation's severity.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Third Offense:</strong> A more extended suspension or termination of your account may occur. In
                cases of severe
                violations,
                system-wide bans or lockdowns may be implemented.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>We also accept anonymous tips and reports of violations.</p>
        <h3>7. Discord Server Rules</h3>
        <p>
            Our Discord server provides an additional platform for communication within the Crooms Bell Schedule
            community.
            In addition to the above Terms, we require the following behavior within the server:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Post content in the appropriate channels. While there are exceptions, each case will be reviewed
                individually.
            </li>
            <li>
                Keep serious discussions within the designated #serious-topics channel.
            </li>
            <li>
                We reserve the right to utilize additional tools, such as an entry buffer channel and a warning channel,
                to
                ensure compliance with these Terms.
            </li>
        </ul>
